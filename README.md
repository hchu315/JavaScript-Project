# Project Title - Rising Tide

### Background and Overview -
  Rising Tide is a data visualization application that seeks to shows the effect of climate change on planet Earth beginning from pre-Industrial Revolution to present day(2018). How has the temperature changed around the world? At what rate has these changes occurred? How has the sea levels changed as a result? What is the carbon footprint of an individual in a developed country? How will these effects in the environment continue to accelerate, given the current trajectory? I am motivated by the prospects of presenting easily digestable data for people to peruse to understand the effects of climate change and consider the prospects of inaction of reducing our carbon footprint as a specie.
  
 (bonus: storm/hurricanes intensity, what changes can we make as individuals or nations?) 
 
### Functionality and MVP Features -
    Users will be able to:
    1) Start the simulation of the changes over the years at the click of a button
      1a) Pause the simulation at any time or return to an earlier part of the timeline
    2) Switch the simulation to a different mode that depicts a different progression
    3) Click on certain countries to depict an average citizen's carbon footprint
    4) Extrapolate data based on current trends to a set time period into the future 
 
### Architecture and Technologies -
    1) Chart.JS/ D3 - to perform the data visualization
    2) Webpack - to bundle scripts into a single source
    3) Vanilla Javascript - for user logic such as playing and stopping simulations, and API calls for data
    4) Canvas - for any additional graphic rendering needed
 
### Implementation Timeline -
    Day 1:
      a) Set up webpack
      b) Research and pick a data visualization tool
      c) Set up page skeleton and other basic functionality
      
    Day 2:
      a) Set up API keys and gather necessary data for visualization
      b) Begin data visualization process
      
    Day 3: 
      a) Complete first simulation(TBD)
      b) Begin additional simulation(s)
      
    Day 4: 
      a) Completion additional simulation(s)
      b) Add carbon footprint feature
      
    Weekend:
      a) Debugging and styling
      b) Add informative texts and instructional information in app
      c) Finish incomplete Github sections and README
